[Cloud-SPAN](https://cloud-span.york.ac.uk) is a project run by the Department of Biology at the University of York with the aim to training researchers in the experimental design and analysis of 'omics data using cloud-based High Performance Computing (HPC) resources.

## Background
Statistics are important in enabling us to understand how robust our data is, and enables us to answer key questions about a dataset. However often many experiments are poorly designed, and can result in data that has no statistical power, and can't answer these questions you're trying to pose. The best way to tackle this is to think about how the data can be collected in a way that will enable the analysis downstream to be robust and defensible/ publishable before the experiment is performed.

This module covers an introduction to statistical design. It does not require any coding experience, unlike some of our other courses. This course also will not include coding as part of the course. This course is going to be discussion led and we will walk through the considerations needed for good statistical design.

### What experience do you need to have before this workshop? What will you be able to do by the end of the workshop?

This lesson assumes no prior experience with designing experiments. Biological knowledge to understand the case studies will be preferred but is not essential
By the end of the module, you will be able to:

- Understand why statistical design is important
- How to incorporate good statistical design into your experiments
- Good practises in design
- You will have the confidance to incorporate lessons learnt into your own work
