[Cloud-SPAN](https://cloud-span.york.ac.uk) is a project run by the Department of Biology at the University of York with the aim to training researchers in the experimental design and analysis of 'omics data using cloud-based High Performance Computing (HPC) resources.


> ## Getting Started
>
> In this half-day workshop we consider some important aspects of useful experimental design. This course will not include coding or software but will be a discussion including some case studies.

## Background
Experimental design is critical for 'omics experiments in order to generate data capable of addressing your research questions and control your reagent costs. There are choices to be made about sample preparation and storage, sequencing technologies, the numbers of technical and biological replicates and sequencing depth. Statistics are important in enabling us to understand how robust our data is, and enables us to answer key questions about a dataset. However often many experiments are poorly designed, and can result in data that has no statistical power, and can't answer these questions you're trying to pose. The best way to tackle this is to think about how the data can be collected in a way that will enable the analysis downstream to be robust and defensible/ publishable before the experiment is performed.



## What experience do you need to have before this workshop? What will you be able to do by the end of the workshop?

This lesson assumes no experience with designing omics' experiments but some previous experience of simple experimental design and statistical testing will useful.
By the end of the module, you will be able to:

- Understand why statistical design is important
- How to incorporate good statistical design into your experiments
- Good practises in design
- You will have the confidance to incorporate lessons learnt into your own work
