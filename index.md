[Cloud-SPAN](https://cloud-span.york.ac.uk) is a collaboration between the [Department of Biology](https://www.york.ac.uk/biology/) at the University of York and [The Software Sustainability Institute](https://www.software.ac.uk/) funded by the UKRI innovation scholars award. It aims to train researchers to effectively generate and analyse a range of 'omics data using Cloud computing resources.

**Statistically useful experimental design** is a 2 - 3 hour workshop about designing 'omics experiments. We consider:
-   what influences platform choice and what influences design when platform choice is fixed 
-   replication and controls
-   sequence coverage and depth
-   Type I and Type II errors and multiple testing correction

> ## Getting Started
>
> This course not not require any software or coding. Some principles of design will be presented followed by discussion of their application using three case studies. There will also be an opportunity for participants to discuss their own designs.
> This module assumes no experience with designing omics' experiments but some previous experience of experimental design and statistical analysis - such as would be covered in an undergraduate bioscience degreee - would be useful.

## Background
Good experimental design is critical for 'omics experiments to ensure they generate data capable of addressing your research questions while controlling your reagent costs. There are choices to be made about sample preparation and storage, sequencing technologies, the numbers of technical and biological replicates and sequencing depth. All of these influence what downstream statistical analysis is possible and determine what generalisations can be made. A good experimental design, appropriate to the budget constraints, will ensure you make the relevant comparions with enough data to provide clear, publishable conclusions.


## Learning outcomes

Following completion of this module, learners will be able to:

- describe why statistical design is important
- make informed choices about sequencing platforms
- make informed decisions about controls and replication
- describe sequence coverage and depth
- critically evaluate their own 'omics experimental designs
